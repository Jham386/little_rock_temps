Looking at our graphs for Little Rock highs, lows, and averages over 21-ish years, we can see no significant increase oor decrease in temperatures overall. There were very general trends for the record highs and lows over the years, but the overall data was too sporadic to give these trends much merit. Just like looking at a picture way too closely, by narrowing in on a two-decade range, it is hard to tell if we are getting the 'big picture.' Regional areas are more erratic than global temperature in that it goes through seasonal variations and is subject to variations like La Nina and El Nino years \cite{el_la_nino_nina}, natural cycles that produce cooler and warmer weather periodically. There are several factors that play into regional temperatures, but global temperature is much more stagnant and a better measure of changes in climate \cite{weather_vs_climate}.
