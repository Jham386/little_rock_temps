The data pulled to complete this project comes from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) online weather data, NOWData. It collects data recorded from stations all over the United States, including precipitation levels and snow depth \cite{NOWData}. However, only the daily highs, lows, and averages were used in this project. The main purpose of taking data from the beginning of the 2000's was to see if, in Little Rock, AR, 22 years would be a sufficent enough scope to see the effects of a warming climate. According to NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, weather and global climate can differ dramatically. While regional temperatures may fluctuate frequently, global temperature rises and regional temperatures follow along, albeit sometiems erraticly \cite{weather_vs_climate}. By analyzing these local highs, lows, and averages, we may or may not be able to notice a trend upwards. Regardless of seeing any trends, we will be able to make out the cyclic seasonal pattern through the 22 years, and see any noticeable highs / lows that occured.
